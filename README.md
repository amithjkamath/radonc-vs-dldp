## Overview

Geometric metrics like Dice score often fail to capture the clinical impact of segmentation errors in radiotherapy. This project introduces a quality assurance (QA) framework using a deep learning-based dose prediction model to assess the **dosimetric impact** of segmentation variations in glioblastoma treatment planning.

The model's performance is compared with three experienced radiation oncologists on a test set of 54 tumor segmentation variants.

## Key Contributions

- A 3D dose prediction model using a cascaded U-Net architecture.
- Evaluation of the modelâ€™s ability to classify segmentation variants as:
  - **Sub-optimal**
  - **No Impact**
  - **Improved**
- Comparison with radiation oncologists in terms of precision, recall, and evaluation time.
- Analysis of sensitivity to dosimetric thresholds (Î±) and number of affected OARs (nOAR).
